The "Goalie" is a robot I designed and manufactured with the help of Randy Ngo, Kyle Chen, and Alexis Herfurth at Caltech for the 40th annual ME 72 Design competition. 
Teams of six students competed against each other in a game of robot street hockey. Each team was allowed to create 3 robots, where one of them acted as a goalie bot. The hockey
rink itself had a ferromagnetic surface, so teams optimized the stability of their robots by placing magnets near the bottom of each robot. 
The team I was on won the competition. More information, as well as the match, can be seen here: https://me72.caltech.edu/
The CAD assembly of the goalie bot does not include electronics, which are placed on the polycarbonate midplate of the assembly inside the goalie bot.
